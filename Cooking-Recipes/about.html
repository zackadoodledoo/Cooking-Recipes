    <h2>Why This Website Exists</h2>
    <p>
        Our Family Recipe Book was created to capture traditions, flavors, and stories passed down through the years.
        These recipes reflect our heritage, our celebrations, and the simple meals we’ve shared at the kitchen table.
    </p>
    <p>Food has always been at the heart of my family’s story. For generations, our recipes have been lovingly written on 3x5 cards and scraps of paper—passed down from parents to children, shared at gatherings, and treasured as a way to keep our traditions alive.</p>
      <p>I created this website to preserve those recipes and bring them into the digital age. By transforming our handwritten notes into an interactive web experience, I hope to honor the legacy of our ancestors while making it easy for our children and future grandchildren to discover, cook, and enjoy the meals that shaped our family.</p>
      <p>This project is more than just a recipe collection—it’s a living archive of love, culture, and memory. Each dish tells a story, and together they weave the fabric of who we are. My goal is to ensure that these stories continue to be told, savored, and celebrated for generations to come.</p>
